Employee Database: 

Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

Designed the tables to hold data in the CSVs, imported the CSVs into a SQL database, and used the database to query the data for insights on the employees. 

### Data Modeling

Inspected the CSVs and sketched out an ERD of the tables. 

### Data Engineering

* Used the information in the table schema for each of the six CSV files. 
* Imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.
